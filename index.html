	<h2>Something cool about me</h2>
	<p>One of my favorite things to do while im bored is listen to music an just relax watching the sky. Sometimes just doing something simple can just be enough and its enough for me to relax and calm the mind.I like to listen to all types of music but the music I mostly like to listen is music with acoustic guitar becuase it is really relaxing and it is such an interesting and amazing instrument and recommend peopel to start learning how to play it. The music I especially like to listen to with guitar is mexican music. They have this guitar with 12 strings or also reffered as "requinto". This instrument is very cool and sounds really good when played in a song so I really recommend it. </p>
	
	<p>Also, another thing that is also cool about me is that I like to run on my free time as a form of exercise and by running it can also relieve your stress and could therefore result in the mood to lighten and make you more happier. Ive been running every since I was really little and always enjoyed it for some reason so I have kept that passion of running ever since. I think this passion of running came to be since the fist every sport I ever joined was cross country and That was the first every thing I actually took apart in a actual team and so maybe thats why I like it to this day.Although running a lot actually is really painfull and isn't for everybody, it is a really good way to exercise and in my opinion the best method to get into shape and most effective and guranteed.  </p>
